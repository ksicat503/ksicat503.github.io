hi, I'm Kevin Sicat. I am currently located in Central Jersey. 

I first earned a Bachelors degree from Rutgers University in Cell Biology and Neuroscience. I then went back to school to complete a second Bachelors from Oregon State University. 

Feel free to check out projects I have built or my resume!
